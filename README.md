# Magma-Engine

Little open source engine I'm building on my free time.

## Goals

* 3D graphics with support for both OpenGL ([GLEW](https://github.com/nigels-com/glew) & [GLFW](https://github.com/glfw/glfw)) and DirectX;
* Game Object / Component system;
* External console for debugging;
* Physics using [Bullet Physics](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3);
* Asset Conditioning Pipeline using [Assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp);
* And many others...
