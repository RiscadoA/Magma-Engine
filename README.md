# Magma-Engine

Little open source engine I'm building on my free time.

## Goals

* 3D graphics with support for both OpenGL ([GLEW](https://github.com/nigels-com/glew) & [GLFW](https://github.com/glfw/glfw)) and DirectX;
* Game Object / Component system;
* External console for debugging;
* Physics using [Bullet Physics](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3);
* Asset Conditioning Pipeline using [Assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp);
* And many others...

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the engine up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installing

[CMake](https://cmake.org/) is used to build this project.

If you're using Windows and you wish to use the Windows Forms console, you will need to build the [windows forms project](https://github.com/RiscadoA/Magma-Engine/tree/master/win-forms-console) and copy the executable to the place where you are running the  engine.
